      "summary": "Ukraine reportedly used its domestically produced Flamingo cruise missile for the first time in an attack on a Russian FSB border post near Armyansk in annexed Crimea. The missile, unveiled in August with a range of up to 3,000 km and a warhead exceeding one ton, was launched on August 31 as shown in videos from Ukrainian sources. While some reports attribute the strike to Neptune missiles, Ukrainian military outlets claim Flamingo missiles were used. Satellite images show possible damage at the target site, but independent confirmation and detailed damage assessments are lacking. The Flamingo missile's long range could enable Ukraine to strike deep into Russian territory, posing a significant challenge to Russian military-industrial facilities. The missile is believed to be a Ukrainian variant of the Emirati FP-5 missile, capable of cruising at speeds up to 900 km/h and flying for up to four hours. Production capacity and quantity of these missiles remain unknown.",

Key attacks included destruction of workshops at the Izhevsk Electromechanical Plant, strikes on a warhead factory in Moscow Region, a chemical plant in Krasnozavodsk, a storage hub in Tatarstan, and sinking an Iranian ship carrying drone parts at the Olya seaport. These operations led to a one-third drop in Shahed drone launches against Ukraine, from 6,303 in July to 4,132 in August. Analysts attribute the decline to disrupted Russian drone stockpiles and production. In response, Russia is building new drone launch sites and expanding production efforts.",
